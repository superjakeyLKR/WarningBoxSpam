# WarningBoxSpam
This spams warning boxes. Feel free to change the title and text of the boxes, if you want. I used IExpress to make these into executable files.
Note: Windows Defender, along with probably many other antiviruses, will see BoxSpam.exe as a threat, so you might need to disable them to use this.
